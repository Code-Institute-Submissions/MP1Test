                        them and everyone tries to avoid them. But with rising pollution and increasing levels of

                        how to get clear skin? While there are millions of products out there for achieving clear skin,

                    too. But excess oil can also be the result of heightened hormone levels, poor diet, lack of sleep
                    and exercise. Oily, acne-prone skin is most common in teenagers but can also occur in adults.</h3>
                <h1 class="my-3">Pros?</h1>
                <h3>If your oily skin is driving you crazy, there’s good news – those with oily skin types tend to have
                    more moisture in their skin, making them less prone to premature wrinkles. The key is to keeping the
                    oiliness of your skin under control so you can put your best face forward.</h3>

                                    <p><strong>What exactly is exfoliation?</strong>
                                        <br>For the folks in the back: Exfoliation a skin-care technique where you
                                        remove dead cells from the top layer of your skin. By removing this layer of
                                        clutter off of your skin, exfoliation helps brighten your complexion, and lets
                                        your skin-care products penetrate deeper into your skin (making them work
                                        better), says Shah.
                                        <br>It’s especially helpful as we age and cell turnover slows down to prevent
                                        skin from looking dull, by keeping the process moving along at a good speed.</p>

                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>There are two types of exfoliation:<br>mechanical and chemical</strong>
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>In mechanical exfoliation, a tool (like a Clarisonic brush or even a
                                                washcloth) or face scrub physically removes the dead skin cells.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>

                                        <li>
                                            <p>Chemical exfoliators, on the other hand, use ingredients like alpha- or
                                                beta hydroxy acids (think a face wash with salicylic acid, or a facial
                                                peel pad with glycolic acid) to dissolve cells, says Shah.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>

                                    <p><strong>How often should you exfoliate your face?</strong>
                                        <br>As a general rule, less is more. The goal is NOT to turn beet red or to feel
                                        a sting—it’s to gently help along your body’s natural exfoliation process so
                                        that your face glows.
                                        <br>As for specifics on how often you should exfoliate, it depends on your skin
                                        type.

                                            <p>For sensitive skin: You should be extra gentle and exfoliate with a warm,
                                                wet washcloth or a mild chemical exfoliant with lower active ingredient
                                                percentages once or twice a week, max. Scrubs with beady parts usually
                                                just irritate this skin type and should be skipped.

                                            <p>For oily skin: Your skin has a higher tolerance for the heavy-duty stuff,
                                                says Shah, and you can exfoliate up to five times a week. Try a
                                                cleansing tool like Clarisonic by morning, and an exfoliating peel or
                                                serum by night.

                                    <p><strong>When should you skip exfoliation?</strong>
                                        <br>Not everyone is meant to go to town with a coffee scrub or intense facial
                                        peel, says Shah. “I see exfoliation in a lot of my acne patients doing more harm
                                        than good,” she says. Why? If you have cystic or chronic acne, your skin is
                                        already inflamed. So irritating it further with harsher exfoliants can leave
                                        behind dark marks known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The marks can
                                        last even longer (and happen more often) in people who have tan to deeper skin
                                        tones, says Shah.
                                        <br>Other times you should hold off on exfoliation: when you have any kind of
                                        cut or open wound on your face, if you have an infection on your face like a
                                        cold sore (it'll spread!), or if you're sunburned. Moisturizer and TLC is more
                                        what your skin needs during those times.

                                        And remember to apply moisturizer to the center of your palm—not your

                                        cheeks will be the driest part of the face (though this can vary depending on

                                    <p>Common mistake: tugging and pulling downward on face and neck skin. No need to

                                        hard or work the product in too vigorously; it will absorb into skin on its own.

                                        gentle hand, and make sure you are always lifting the skin—never dragging it

                                        you tame oil production or make it worse. “Use products labelled with terms
                                        like<strong>
                                            ‘non-comedogenic,’ ‘non-acnegenic,’ ‘doesn’t clog pores,’ or ‘won’t cause
                                            breakouts,’</strong>” says David Lortscher, MD, California-based
                                        board-certified
                                        dermatologist and CEO of Curology. “This indicates the manufacturer considers
                                        the
                                        product to be designed for people with oily or acne-prone skin.” It’s not a
                                        guarantee,
                                        he adds, since everyone’s skin reacts differently, but it can be a useful
                                        guideline.
                                        <br>Also, look for active ingredients that help the oil gland function more
                                        normally,
                                        like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, zinc, retinoids, and sulfur.
                                        “Lighter formulations are likely to be better tolerated—these include serums,
                                        gels,
                                        lotions, or powders, rather than creams or ointments,” says Dr. Palm.
                                        <br>If you’re unsure about a product, Dr. Lortscher recommends using cosDNA.com
                                        to
                                        research your skincare products in their database. Pull up and run the
                                        ingredient list
                                        through the “analyze cosmetics” section, and check out the “acne” column: If

                                    <p>Use an oil-fighting cleanser.
                                        <br>Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to use an aggressive face wash to
                                        de-grease your skin—in fact, going too strong may cause rebound oil production.
                                        Go with
                                        a gentle foaming cleanser instead, says Dr. Lortscher, preferably one that
                                        contains
                                        salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, which penetrate your pores and keeps them
                                        gunk-free.
                                        Try the following dermatologist approved options:
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Then, let your cleanser do the work.
                                        <br>Scrubbing your skin can strip your skin of its natural protective oils and,
                                        paradoxically, trigger increased oil production. “The goal is to remove physical
                                        dirt
                                        and emulsify the excess oils and grease so they rinse off—it isn’t to irritate
                                        your
                                        skin,” says Dr. Shainhouse. Simply wet your skin, and using a nickel-sized
                                        amount of
                                        cleanser, lather up the product and gently massage it onto your face. Your
                                        cleanser will
                                        take care of the rest.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>But don’t wash your face too often.
                                        <br>It can be tempting to wash your face several times a day with oil-zapping
                                        cleansers
                                        to keep your skin looking matte, but doing so can actually backfire. “When you
                                        over-wash, you remove the protective natural oils, which can leave your skin
                                        feeling
                                        dry, tight, and parched,” says Dr. Shainhouse. <strong>Because your skin can’t
                                            produce
                                            its own moisture, it responds to the dryness by making more oil</strong>. To
                                        stop
                                        this cycle, only wash your face in the morning, at night, and after exercise.

                                    <p>Tweak your toner usage.
                                        <br>Don’t use drying toners (think: alcohol-based), apple cider vinegar, or
                                        rubbing
                                        alcohol to evict grease from your skin. “These solutions will physically remove
                                        surface
                                        grease, but dry out the top layer of your skin,” says Dr. Shainhouse, and
                                        potentially
                                        lead to rebound oil production. If you feel like you need a toner step, Dr.
                                        Shainhouse
                                        recommends going with a micellar water that contains both astringent (charcoal,

                                        mattify and protect your skin.
                                        <br><br>If your skin can tolerate micellar water without getting irritated,
                                        consider a
                                        gentle formula like Simple Micellar Water (it’s great for sensitive skin, says
                                        Dr.
                                        Shainhouse) or La Roche Posay Effaclar Micellar Water for Oily Skin, which
                                        cleanses,
                                        hydrates (with glycerin) and keeps oil production at bay (with zinc).

                                    <p>Never skip moisturizer.
                                        <br>It seems counterintuitive to moisturize skin that’s always shiny and greasy,
                                        but
                                        doing so gives your skin an added layer of protection against rebound oil
                                        production,
                                        says Dr. Shainhouse. Apply a light, oil-free moisturizer after washing your
                                        face.
                                    </p>

                                <li>
                                    <p>Always wear sunscreen.
                                        <br>Sunscreen doesn’t have to make your face look greasy, so long as you choose
                                        the
                                        right product for your skin type. Opt for a lightweight formula that contains
                                        mineral
                                        blockers, like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, says Dr. Shainhouse. Chemical
                                        formulations are fine too—just make sure to choose a gel or light liquid formula
                                        that’s
                                        made for faces.
                                        <br>Dr. Palm’s top pick is Elta MD Clear SPF 46, as it’s a non-comedogenic
                                        formulation
                                        that contains no heavy moisturizers. Plus, “zinc oxide and niacinamide are
                                        anti-inflammatory and don’t promote oil production,” she says. And if you find
                                        you’re
                                        still on the shiny side, use a loose mineral powder sunscreen for touch-ups,
                                        such as
                                        Colorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection SPF 50, suggests Dr. Shainhouse.

                                        during the day. Dr. Palm recommends OC8 Professional Mattifying Gel: “It
                                        contains a
                                        polymer called acrysorb, which attaches to and absorbs oil on the skin,” she
                                        says. Best
                                        of all, it helps to reduce shine for up to eight hours.
